# Simple Hotel Management System

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Simple Hotel Management System** is a console-based application developed in **C++**. The system is designed to manage basic hotel operations such as room booking, guest check-in and check-out, and bill calculation. It is intentionally kept simple to focus on software engineering concepts like **UML modeling**, **object-oriented programming**, and **Agile project management**.

This project was completed as a **team-based academic assignment** using Agile practices and Jira for task management.
